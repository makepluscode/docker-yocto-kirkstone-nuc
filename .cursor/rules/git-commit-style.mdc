# Git Commit Message Style Guide

All git commit messages must follow the rules in [GIT_COMMIT_RULE.md](mdc:GIT_COMMIT_RULE.md):

- Messages must be in English and start with a capital letter.
- Use Conventional Commits prefixes: feat, fix, docs, chore, refactor, style, test, perf.
- Prefix and message are separated by a colon and a space.
- Message should be concise (16~32 words), not imperative.
- See [GIT_COMMIT_RULE.md](mdc:GIT_COMMIT_RULE.md) for full details and examples.
