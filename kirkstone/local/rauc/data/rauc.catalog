Defined-By: rauc
Support: https://rauc.io
Documentation: https://rauc.readthedocs.io

An error occurred while attempting to install the update bundle with hash
@BUNDLE_HASH@ on your system
and thus the installation with transaction ID @TRANSACTION_ID@ failed.

While target slot contents can be inconsistent or partially written, the slots
of the running system will not be affected.

Use 'rauc status' to check if the bootable slot group is deactivated (marked as
'bad'). Add '--detailed' option to see the slot's individual status.

choice.
This will boot the system installed from bundle @BUNDLE_HASH@.

Where this information is persisted, mainly depends on the bootloader used
(configured in your RAUC system config).
